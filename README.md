# NOTES

I was able to finish this task in 7,5h. There is only one 'issue'. Saving lists and items is done only on FE. It is not saved inside JSON file. I chose this approach to save time.
Creating new boards is fully functional, with saving to JSON file on BE side as a demonstration, that I know how to do it.
I tried not to overengineer it. With more time, I would be able to make components 'nicer' and fiddle with visuals more.
